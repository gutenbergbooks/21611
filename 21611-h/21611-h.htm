<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>A truthful narrative, not a tale of fiction,
is presented in the following chapters
to our readers. All that the imagination
has contributed to it has been the
names of the actors,&mdash;true names having
been withheld, lest, perhaps, friends
might be grieved,&mdash;the filling up of the
dialogues, in which, while thoughts and
sentiments have been remembered, the
verbiage that clothed them has been forgotten,
and, in a few instances, the
grouping together of incidents that actually
occurred at wider intervals than here
represented, for the sake of the unity of
the story.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>RODNEY UNHAPPY IN A GOOD HOME.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capi.jpg" width="115" height="120" alt="I" /></div><p>T was a lovely Sabbath morning
in May, 1828, when two
lads, the elder of whom was
about sixteen years old, and the younger
about fourteen, were wandering along
the banks of a beautiful brook, called
the Buttermilk Creek, in the immediate
vicinity of the city of Albany, N. Y.
Though there is no poetry in the name
of this little stream, there is sweet music<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8" href="#Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
made by its rippling waters, as they rush
rapidly along the shallow channel, fretting
at the rocks that obstruct its course,
and racing toward a precipice, down
which it plunges, some thirty or forty
feet, forming a light, feathery cascade;
and then, as if exhausted by the leap,
creeping sluggishly its little distance
toward the broad Hudson. The white
spray, churned out by the friction against
the air, and flung perpetually upwards,
suggested to our sires a name for this
miniature Niagara; and, without any
regard for romance or euphony, they
called it Buttermilk Falls. It was
a charming spot, notwithstanding its
homely name, before the speculative
spirit of progress&mdash;stern foe of Nature's
beauties&mdash;had pushed the borders of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9" href="#Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
city close upon the tiny cataract, hewed
down the pines upon its banks, and
opened quarries among its rocks.</p>

<p>It was before this change had passed
over the original wilderness, that the lads
whom we have mentioned were strolling,
in holy time, upon the banks of the little
stream, above the falls.</p>

<p>"Rodney," said the elder of the boys,
"suppose your mother finds out that
you have run away from Sunday-school,
this morning; what will she say to
you?"</p>

<p>"Why, she will be very likely to punish
me," said Rodney; "but you know
I am used to it; and, though decidedly
unpleasant, it does not grate on my
nerves as it did a year or two ago. Van
Dyke, my teacher, says I am hardened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10" href="#Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
But I would rather have a stroll here,
and a flogging after it, than be shut up
in school and church all day to escape it.
I wish, Will, that mother was like your
grandfather, and would let me do as I
please on Sunday."</p>

<p>"Now that I am an apprentice,"
replied Will Manton, "and shut up in
the shop all the week, it would be rather
hard to prevent my having a little sport
on Sunday. I think it is necessary to
swallow a little fresh air on Sunday, to
blow the sawdust out of my throat; and
to have a game of ball occasionally, to
keep my joints limber, for they get stiff
leaning over the work-bench, shoving the
jack-plane, and chiseling out mortices all
the week."</p>

<p>"Well, Will, I, too, get very sick of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11" href="#Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
work," replied the younger boy. "I
do not think I ever shall like it. When
I am roused up early in the morning,
and go into the shop, and look at the
tools, and think that, all day long, I
must stand and pull leather strands, while
other boys can go free, and take their
sport, and swim, or fish, or hunt, or play,
just as they please, it makes me feel like
running away. Now, here am I, a little
more than fourteen years old; and must
I spend seven years in a dirty shop,
with the prospect of hard work all my
life? It makes my heart sick to think
of it."</p>

<p>The boys threw themselves upon the
ground, under the shade of a large pine,
and, reclining against its trunk, remained
some minutes without uttering a word.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12" href="#Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
At length, William Manton, whose
thoughts had evidently been running in
the channel opened by the last remarks
of Rodney, said,</p>

<p>"I have often thought of it."</p>

<p>"Thought of what, Will?"</p>

<p>"Of running away."</p>

<p>"Where could you go? What could
you do? How could you live?" were
the quick, eager inquiries of Rodney.</p>

<p>"Three questions at once is worse
than the catechism," was the laughing
response; "but, though I never learned
the answers out of a book, yet I have
them by heart. I will tell you what I
have thought about the matter. You
know Captain Ryan?&mdash;he was in our
shop last week, and was telling how he
came to be a sailor. He said that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13" href="#Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
uncle, with whom he lived when he was
a boy, promised him a beating, one day,
for some mischief he had done; and, as
he had often felt before that his lashes
were not light, he ran off, went on board
a ship as a cabin-boy, learned to handle
sails and ropes, and, after five or six
voyages, was made mate of a ship; and
now he is a captain. I have been thinking
about it ever since. Now, if I could
get a place in a ship, I would go in a
minute. I am sure travelling over the
world must be pleasanter than spending
a life in one place; and pulling a rope is
easier work than pushing a plane."</p>

<p>Rodney sprang up from his reclining
posture, looked straight in his companion's
face for a moment, and exclaimed,
"That would be glorious! How I should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14" href="#Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
like to go to London, to Canton, to Holland,
where the old folks came from,&mdash;to
travel all over the world! But,"&mdash;and
he leaned back against the tree again
as he spoke,&mdash;"but it is of no use to
think about it; mother would not consent,
and nobody would help me; no
ship would take me. I suppose I must
pull away at the leather all my life."
He spoke bitterly, and leaned his face
upon his hands; and, between his fingers,
the tears were seen slowly trickling.
In truth, he had no taste or inclination
for the trade to which he was
forced. If the bias of his own mind had
been consulted, he might have been contented
in some employment adapted to
his nature.</p>

<p>"Bah, Rodney, don't be a baby!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15" href="#Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
was the jeering expostulation of Will
Manton, when he saw the tears; "crying
never got a fellow out of a scrape.
I believe it is easy enough done. If we
could only get off to New York, they say
that boys are so much wanted on ships,
that the captains take them without asking
many questions."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Don't you think it is worth a trial?"</p>

<p>"But I should have to leave my
mother, and grandmother, and sister,
and all."</p>

<p>"Of course; you would not want to
take them with you, would you?"</p>

<p>"But I could not tell them I was
going. I should have to steal away
without their knowledge."</p>

<p>"You could write to them when you
started."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16" href="#Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>"I might never see them again."</p>

<p>"You are as likely to live and come
back as Captain Ryan was."</p>

<p>"But they would feel so much hurt,
if I should run away."</p>

<p>Will Manton curled his lip into a
sneer, and said, scornfully, "Why, Rodney,
I didn't think you was so much of
a baby. You are a more faint-hearted
chicken than I thought you."</p>

<p>"Well, Will, the thought of it frightens
me. I have a good mother and a
good grandmother; and, though they
make me learn a trade I hate, yet I do
not think I should dare to run away."</p>

<p>"Well, you poor mouse-heart, stay at
home, then, and tie yourself to your
mamma's apron-strings!" was the reply.
"Do as you please; but, I tell you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17" href="#Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>&mdash;and
I trust the secret to you, and hope
you won't <i>blow</i> it,&mdash;I have made up
my mind to go to sea."</p>

<p>"Will you run away?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Why should I tell you, if you will
not go with me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to be off with you,
but how can I?"</p>

<p>"Easy enough. But I will see you
to-morrow night, and we will talk it
over. It is time to go home."</p>

<p>"I must see Dick Vanderpool, and
find out where the text was, so that I
can tell the old folks."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18" href="#Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>REVOLVING AND RESOLVING.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capc.jpg" width="115" height="114" alt="C" /></div><p>ONVERSATIONS similar to
those recorded in the last
chapter, were frequently held
between the two lads, during the next
month. Will Manton's determination
was fixed, and he was making secret
preparations to start upon his wild journey.
Rodney, though equally desirous
to escape the restraints of home, could
not yet make up his mind to risk the
adventure. He regarded his comrade as
a sort of young hero; and he wished he
had the courage to be like him.</p>

<p>One Monday morning, in June, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19" href="#Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
was returning from his work, he saw
Will Manton's old grandfather standing
before the door, looking up and down
the street; and he noticed that he
seemed very uneasy, and much distressed.
When he came opposite the
house, on the other side of the street,
the old gentleman called him over, and
asked him, "Rodney, do you know where
Will is?"</p>

<p>The boy's heart beat wildly, and his
cheek turned pale; for he at once surmised
that his comrade had carried out
his purpose. He stammered out, in
reply,</p>

<p>"I have not seen him since last Friday
night."</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said the old
man. "He has not been at home since<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20" href="#Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
last Sunday, at dinner-time. What has
become of him?"</p>

<p>Will Manton was gone!</p>

<p>To the anxious inquiries that were
made, his friends discovered that he had
left Albany in the evening boat, on
Tuesday, for New York. Though a
messenger was immediately sent after
him, no trace of him could be discovered.
A few months after, they received
a letter from him, written from Liverpool,
where he had gone in a merchant-ship,
as a cabin-boy. His friends were very
much grieved and distressed, but hoped
that he would soon grow weary of a hard
and roving life, and return to his home.</p>

<p>There was a romantic interest in all
this for young Rodney. In his imagination,
Will Manton was a hero. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21" href="#Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
scarcely ever out of his thoughts. He
would follow him in fancy, bounding
over the broad sea, with all the sails of
the majestic ship swelling in the favoring
breeze, now touching at some island,
and looking at the strange dresses and
customs of a barbarous people; now
meeting a homeward-bound vessel, and
exchanging joyful greetings; and now
lying to in a calm, and spearing dolphins
and harpooning whales. When
the storm raged, he almost trembled lest
he might be wrecked; but, when it was
over, he fancied the noble ship, having
weathered the storm, stemming safely
the high waves, and careering gracefully
on her course. Or, if he was
wrecked, he imagined that he must be
cast upon some shore where the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22" href="#Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>hospitable
inhabitants hurried down to the beach
to the relief of the crew, bore them
safely through the breakers, and pressed
upon them the comforts of their homes.
His wild imagination followed him to
other lands, and roved with him along
the streets of European cities, among the
ruins of Grecian temples, over the gardens
of Spain and the vineyards of Italy,
through the pagodas of India, and the
narrow streets of Calcutta and Canton.</p>

<p>"O," thought he, "how delightful
must be such a life! How pleasant to
be roaming amid scenes that are always
new! And how wretched to be tied to
such a life as I lead, following the same
weary round of miserable drudgery every
day!"</p>

<p>But it was Rodney's own fancy that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23" href="#Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
painted this enjoyment of a sailor-boy's
life. Will Manton did not find it so
pleasant in reality. There was more
menial drudgery to the poor cabin-boy on
ship-board, than he had ever known in the
carpenter's shop. He was sworn at, and
thumped, and kicked, and driven from
one thing to another, by the captain, and
mates, and steward, and crew, all day
long. And many a night, when, weary
and sore, he crept to his hard, narrow
bunk, he lay and cried himself to sleep,
thinking of his kind and pleasant home.</p>

<p>When Fancy pictures before the restless
mind distant and unknown scenes,
she divests them of all the rough realities
which a nearer view and a tried experience
find in them. The mountain-side
looks smooth and pleasant from a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24" href="#Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>distance,
but we find it rugged and wearisome
when we attempt to climb it.</p>

<p>One idea had now gained almost sole
possession of poor Rodney's mind. He
must go to sea! He thought of it all
day, and dreamed of it at night. He
did not dare to speak about it to his
mother, for he knew that she would
refuse her consent. He must <i>run away</i>!
He formed a hundred different plans, and
was forced to abandon them. Now Will
Manton was gone, there was no one with
whom he could consult. He was afraid
to speak of it, lest it should reach the
ears of his mother. Alone he nursed his
resolution, and formed his plans.</p>

<p>He was very unhappy, because he
knew that he was purposing wrong. He
could not be contented with his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25" href="#Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>employment,
and he knew how it would grieve
the hearts of those who loved him, if he
should persist in his design. Yet, when
he pictured to himself the freedom from
restraint, the pleasure of roaming from
place to place over the world, and the
thousand exciting scenes and adventures
which he should meet by becoming a
sailor, he determined, at all hazards, to
make the attempt.</p>

<p>Unhappy boy! He was sowing, for
his own reaping, the seeds of a bitter
harvest of wretchedness and remorse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26" href="#Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>RODNEY IN NEW YORK.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capo.jpg" width="115" height="118" alt="O" /></div><p>N a beautiful Sabbath morning
in July, Rodney stood in
the hall of the old Dutch
house in which successive generations of
the family had been born, and paused to
look the last farewell, he dare not speak,
upon those who loved him, and whom,
notwithstanding his waywardness, he
also loved.</p>

<p>There sat his pious and venerable
grandmother, with the little round stand
before her, upon which lay the old family
Bible, over which she was intently
bending, reading and commenting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27" href="#Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
herself, as was her custom, in half-audible
tones. He had often stood behind
her, and listened, unobserved, as she
read verse after verse, and paused after
each, to testify of its truth, or piously
apply it to herself and others. And now
he thought that, in all probability, he
would never see her again, and he half
repented his determination. But his
preparations were all made, and he could
not now hesitate, lest his purpose should
be discovered.</p>

<p>He looked at his mother, as she was
arranging the dress of a younger and
only brother, for the Sabbath-school.
As she leaned over him, and smoothed
down the collar she had just fastened
round his neck, Rodney, with heart and
eye, bade farewell to both.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28" href="#Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>He stood and gazed for a moment
upon his only sister, who sat with her
baby in her arms, answering the little
laughing prattler in a language that
sounded like its own, and which certainly
none but the two could understand.
Some might doubt whether they
understood it themselves; but they both
seemed highly interested and delighted
by the conversation.</p>

<p>That dear sister, amiable and loving,
is long since dead. She greeted death
with a cheerful welcome, for the messenger
released her from a life of domestic
unhappiness, and introduced her into
that blessed heaven "where the wicked
cease from troubling, and the weary are
at rest."</p>

<p>And that prattling infant has become,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29" href="#Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
in his turn, a runaway sailor-boy, flying
from an unhappy home to a more wretched
destiny, of whose wanderings or existence
nothing has been heard for many
years.</p>

<p>It was one hasty, intense glance
which Rodney cast over these groups,
and each beloved figure, as it then appeared,
was fixed in his memory forever.
He has never forgotten&mdash;<i>he never can
forget</i>&mdash;that moment, or the emotions
that thrilled his heart as he turned away
from them.</p>

<p>He had hidden a little trunk, containing
his clothing, in the stable, and thither
he hastened; and, throwing his trunk
upon his shoulder, he stole out of the
back gate, and took his course through
bye streets to the dock, where he went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30" href="#Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
on board a steamboat, and in half an
hour was sailing down the Hudson
towards New York.</p>

<p>He had no money with which to pay
his passage. He had left home without
a single sixpence. When the captain
came to collect the passengers' fare, he
told him a wicked, premeditated lie.
He said that, in taking his handkerchief
from his pocket, he had accidentally
drawn out his pocket-book with it, and
that it had fallen overboard. Thus one
sin prepares the way to the commission
of another.</p>

<p>He offered to leave his trunk in
pledge for the payment of the passage;
and the captain, after finding it full of
clothing, ordered it to be locked up
until the money was paid. Rodney <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31" href="#Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>expected
to be able to get a situation in
some ship immediately, and to receive a
part of his wages in advance, with which
he could redeem his clothing.</p>

<p>He slept on board the steamboat, and
on Monday morning started in search
of a ship that would take him. He
wandered along the wharves, and at first
was afraid to speak to any one, lest he
should be questioned and sent home.
At last he made up his mind to ask a
sailor, whom he saw sauntering on the
dock, if he knew where he could get a
place on board a ship.</p>

<p>The sailor looked at him a moment,
turned his huge tobacco quid over in his
mouth, hitched up his trowsers, and
said:</p>

<p>"Why, you young runaway, do you
want to go to sea? What can such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32" href="#Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
chap as you do on a ship? Go home,
and stick by your mammy for five years
more, and then you'll have no trouble
in shipping."</p>

<p>Rodney was a good deal frightened at
such a reply, and walked on for some
time, not venturing to ask again. Toward
noon he went on board a large
vessel, and seeing a man, whom he took
for the captain of the ship, asked him if
he could give him a place.</p>

<p>"No, my boy," he replied; "we
don't sail for three weeks, and we never
ship a crew before the time."</p>

<p>All day he wandered about the
wharves, and to all his questions received
repelling replies, mingled oftentimes
with oaths, jeers, and insults. No
one seemed to feel the least interest for
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33" href="#Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>RODNEY FINDS A PATRON.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capl.jpg" width="115" height="119" alt="L" /></div><p>ATE in the afternoon Rodney
strolled up the East River
wharves. He was hungry,
for he had eaten nothing all day. He
was very sad, and sat down on a cotton
bale, and cried. In what a position had
a single day placed him! He had no
place where he could lay his head for
the night, no bread to eat, and he knew
nobody whom he dared to ask for a
meal; and so, with a sorrowful heart,
he sat down and wept.</p>

<p>He buried his face in his hands, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34" href="#Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for a long time sat there motionless.
He did not know that a man was standing
before him, watching him, until he
was startled by a voice:</p>

<p>"Why, my boy, what is the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>He looked up, and saw a tall man in a
sailor's dress standing near him.</p>

<p>"I want to get a place on a ship, sir,
to go to sea," replied Rodney; "I can't
find any place, and I have no money and
no friends here."</p>

<p>The man sat down beside him, and
asked him, "Where are your friends?"</p>

<p>"In Albany, sir."</p>

<p>"What did you leave them for?"</p>

<p>"Because I wanted to go to sea."</p>

<p>They talked some time together, and
Rodney told him truly all about himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35" href="#Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and his friends. The man seemed to
pity him, and told him that he was a
sailor, and had lately been discharged
from a United States vessel, where he
had served as a marine,&mdash;that he had
spent almost all his money, and was
looking for another ship. He told Rodney
to go with him, and he would try
what could be done for him. They went
into a sailors' boarding-house, and got
something to eat.</p>

<p>Then the man,&mdash;who said his name
was Bill Seegor, and that he must call him
Bill, and not Mister, nor sir,&mdash;took him
with himself into a ball-room. Here he
saw a great many sailors and bad women,
who danced together, and laughed, and
shouted, and cursed, and drank, until
long past midnight. Rodney had never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36" href="#Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
witnessed <i>such</i> a scene. He had never
heard such filthy and blasphemous language,
nor seen such indecent behavior.</p>

<p>"Come, my lad," said a bluff sailor
to him; "if you mean to be a man,
you must learn to toss off your glass.
Your white face don't look as if you ever
tasted anything stronger than tea. Here
is a glass of grog,&mdash;down with it!"</p>

<p>And Rodney, who wanted to be a
man, drank it with a swaggering air,
though it scorched his throat; and then
another, until he became very sick;&mdash;and
the last he remembered was, that
the sailors and the women all seemed to
be swearing and fighting together.</p>

<p>The next morning he was awaked by
Bill Seegor, and found himself in a garret,
on a miserable bed, with all his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37" href="#Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
clothes on. How he had ever got there
he could not tell. His head ached, and
his limbs were stiff and pained him when
he moved. His throat was parched and
burning, and he felt so wretchedly, that,
if he had dared, he would have begged
permission to stay there on the bed.
But Bill told him that it was time to
start and look up a ship, for he had only
money enough to last another day. After
breakfast they started, and inquired
at every place which Bill knew, but
without success; no men or boys were
wanted.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Rodney was terribly
frightened at seeing his brother-in-law
walking along the wharves. He knew
in a moment that he had come to New
York to search for him; and he darted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38" href="#Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
round a corner into an alley, and hid
himself behind some barrels, till he had
passed by. He afterwards learned that
his brother-in-law had been looking for
him all day, and that he had found and
taken his trunk, and had been several
times at places which he had just left.
O! if he had then abandoned his foolish
and wicked course, and gone home with
his brother, how much misery he would
have escaped! But he contrived to
keep out of his way.</p>

<p>That evening Bill said to him, as they
were eating their supper in a cellar&mdash;</p>

<p>"Rodney, to-morrow morning we
must start for Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"But how shall we get there?"</p>

<p>"We shall have to tramp it."</p>

<p>"How far is it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39" href="#Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"About a hundred miles."</p>

<p>"How long will it take?"</p>

<p>"Four or five days."</p>

<p>"But how shall we get anything to
eat, or any place to sleep on the road?"</p>

<p>"Tell a good story to the farmers,
and sleep on the hay-mows."</p>

<p>Rodney began to find out that "<i>the
way of the transgressor is hard</i>."</p>

<p>That night they went to the theatre.
Bill had given Rodney a dirk, which he
carried in his bosom. They went up
into the third tier of boxes, which was
filled with the most wicked and debased
men and women. While the rest were
laughing, and talking, and cursing, Rodney
sat down on the front seat to see the
play; but they made so much confusion
behind him that he could not hear, so he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40" href="#Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
turned round, and said, rather angrily:
"I wish you wouldn't make so much
noise."</p>

<p>"Who are you talking to?" shouted
a rough, bully-looking man behind him,
with a terrible oath; "I'll pitch you
into the pit, if you open your head
again."</p>

<p>He rushed towards him, but, quick as
thought, Rodney snatched the dirk from
his breast, drew his arm back over his
head, and told the bully to keep off.
The man stopped, and in an instant the
whole theatre was in confusion. The
play on the stage ceased; and there, in
full view, leaning over the front of the
box, stood the boy, with the weapon in
his hand, gleaming in the eyes of the
whole audience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41" href="#Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Bill Seegor rushed to him, pulled him
back toward the lobby, and took the
dagger from his hand. The bully then
aimed a tremendous blow at the boy's
face, which fortunately was warded off
by one of the women. Just then a police-officer
came up, and, taking Rodney
by the collar, led him down stairs.
Half a dozen men, who were Bill's
friends, followed; and when they got
into the street, they dashed against the
officer, and broke his hold, when Bill
caught Rodney by the arm and told him
to run. They turned quickly through
several streets, and escaped pursuit.</p>

<p>Do you think that Rodney was happy
amid such scenes? Ah! no; he was
alarmed at himself. He felt degraded
and guilty; he felt that he was taking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42" href="#Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
sudden and rapid strides in the path of
debasement and vice. He thought of
his home and its sweet influences. He
knew how deep would be the grief of
those who loved him, should they hear
of his course. His conscience condemned
him, and he thought of what he
was becoming with horror. But he
seemed to be drawn on by his wild desires,
and felt scarcely a disposition to
escape the meshes of the net that was
winding around him.</p>

<p>The sailors praised him, and patted
him on the back; told him that he was
a brave fellow,&mdash;that he was beginning
right, and that there was good stuff in
him. And Rodney laughed, tickled by
such praises, and drank what they offered,
and tried to stifle his conscience<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43" href="#Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and harden himself in sin. Yet often,
when he was alone, did he shrink from
himself, and writhe under the lashings
of conscience; and the remembrance of
home, and thoughts of his conduct, rendered
him very wretched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44" href="#Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>RODNEY IN PHILADELPHIA.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capy.jpg" width="115" height="117" alt="Y" /></div><p>OUNG Rodney was prepared
for an early start on the following
morning; and, in
company with Bill Seegor, he crossed
the ferry to Jersey City just as the sun
rose, and together they commenced their
journey to Philadelphia. They were
soon beyond the pavements of the town,
and in the open country. It was a
lovely morning, and the bright summer
developed its beauties, and dispensed its
fragrance along their path. The birds
sang sweetly, and darted on swift wing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45" href="#Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
around them. The cattle roamed lazily
over the fields, and the busy farmers
were everywhere industriously toiling.
All nature seemed joyously reflecting
the serene smile of a benevolent God.</p>

<p>Even the wicked hearts of the wanderers
seemed lightened by the influence
of the glorious morning, and cheerily,
with many a jocund song and homely
jest, they pressed on their way. Even
guilt can sometimes forget its baseness,
and enjoy the bounties of the kind Creator,
for which it expresses no thankfulness
and feels no gratitude.</p>

<p>At noon they stopped at a farmer's
house, and Bill told the honest old man
that they belonged to a ship which had
sailed round to Philadelphia; that it
had left New York unexpectedly, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46" href="#Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>out
their knowledge, and taken their
chests and clothes which had been
placed on board; and that, being without
money, they were compelled to walk
across to Philadelphia to meet it.</p>

<p>The farmer believed the falsehood,
and charitably gave them a good dinner.
They walked on till after sunset, and
then crossed over a field, and climbed up
into a rack filled with hay, where they
slept all night.</p>

<p>In the morning they started forward
very hungry, for they had eaten nothing,
since the noon before, except a few
green apples. They stopped at the first
farm-house on the road, and, by telling
the same falsehood that had procured
them a meal the day before, excited the
pity of the farmer and obtained a good
breakfast.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47" href="#Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus did they go on, lying and begging
their way along.</p>

<p>On the third day there were heavy
showers, accompanied by fierce lightnings
and crashing thunders. They
were as thoroughly soaked as if they
had been thrown into the river, and at
night had to sleep on a haystack, in the
open field, in their wet clothes. Rodney's
feet, too, had become very sore,
and he walked in great and constant
pain.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the fourth day
they stopped on the banks of the Delaware,
five or six miles from Philadelphia,
to wash their clothes, which had
become filthy in travelling through the
dust and mud. As they had no clothing
but what they wore, there was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48" href="#Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
else to be done but to strip, wash out
their soiled garments, and lay them out
on the bank to dry, while they swam
about the river, or waited on the shore,
with what patience they could summon.</p>

<p>A little after sunset they reached the
suburbs of the great city; and now the
sore feet and wearied limbs of the boy
could scarcely sustain him over the hard
pavements. Yet Bill urged him onward
with many an impatient oath, on
past the ship-yards of Kensington,&mdash;on,
past the factories, and markets, and
farmers' taverns, and shops of the Northern
Liberties,&mdash;on, through the crowded
thoroughfares, and by the brilliant stores
of the city,&mdash;on, into the most degraded
section of Southwark, in Plumb-street,
where Bill said a friend of his lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49" href="#Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
This friend was an abandoned woman,
who lived in a miserable frame cabin,
crowded with wicked and degraded
wretches, who seemed the well-known
and fitting companions of Rodney's patron.
The woman for whom he inquired
was at a dance in the neighborhood, and
there Bill took the boy in search of her.</p>

<p>They went up a dark alley, and were
admitted into a large room filled with
men and women, black and white, the
dregs and outcasts of society.</p>

<p>A few dripping candles, placed in tin
sconces along the bare walls, threw a
dim and sickly glare over the motley
throng. A couple of negro men, sitting
on barrels at the head of the room, were
drawing discordant notes from a pair of
cracked, patched, and greasy fiddles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50" href="#Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
And there were men, whose red and
bloated faces gave faithful witness of
their habitual intemperance; and men,
whose threadbare and ragged garments
betokened sloth and poverty; and men,
whose vulgar and ostentatious display of
showy clothing, and gaudy chains, and
rings and breast-pins, which they did
not know how to wear, indicated dishonest
pursuits; and men, whose blue
jackets and bluff, brown faces showed
them to be sailors; and men, whose
scowling brows and fiendlike countenances
marked them as villains of the
blackest and lowest type. And there
were women, too, some old&mdash;at least,
they looked so&mdash;and haggard; some
young, but with wretched-looking faces,
and dressed in tawdry garments, yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51" href="#Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
generally faded, some torn and some
patched, and all seeming to be brought
from the pawnbroker's dusty shop for
the occasion.</p>

<p>In a little filthy side-room was a bar
covered with bottles and glasses, behind
which stood a large, red-faced man, with
a big nose, and little ferret, fiery eyes,
now grinning like a satyr, now scowling
like a demon, dealing out burning liquors
to his miserable customers.</p>

<p>A man fell beastly drunk from a bench
upon the floor. "Take him up stairs,"
said the man at the bar. Rodney followed
the two men who carried him up,
and looked into the sleeping apartment.
The floor was covered with dirty straw,
where lodgers were accommodated for
three cents a night. Here the poor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52" href="#Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
wretches were huddled together every
night, to get what sleep they could in
the only home they had on earth.</p>

<p>Thus does vice humble, and degrade,
and scourge those who are taken in its
toils. From the threshold of the house
of guilty pleasure there may issue the
song and laugh of boisterous mirth; but
those who enter within shall find disgrace
and infamy, woe and death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53" href="#Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE PUNISHMENT BEGINS.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capb.jpg" width="115" height="112" alt="B" /></div><p>ILL Seegor found the
woman he sought, and soon
they returned to her house.
Here the bottle was brought out and
passed round; and, after much blasphemous
and ribaldrous conversation, a
straw bed was made up on the floor,
and Rodney laid down. Before he went
to sleep, he heard Bill tell the woman
that he was entirely out of money, and
beg her to lend him five dollars for a
few days. After some hesitation she
consented, and drew out from under the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54" href="#Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
bed an old trunk, which she unlocked,
and from which she took five dollars in
silver and gave it to him. Bill, looking
over her shoulder, saw that she took it
from a little pile of silver that lay in the
corner of the trunk.</p>

<p>For a long time Rodney could not
sleep. The scenes of the last eventful
week were vividly recalled to his mind,
and, in spite of his fatigue, kept him
awake. He tried to make himself believe
that it was a glorious life he had
begun to lead,&mdash;that now he was free
from restraint, and entering upon the
flowery paths of independence and enjoyment.
Though he had met with some
difficulties at the start, he thought that
they were now nearly passed, and that
soon he should be upon the blue water,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55" href="#Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
and in foreign countries, a happy sailor
boy.</p>

<p>But conscience would interpose its
reproaches and warnings, and remind
him of the horrible company into which
he had been cast,&mdash;of the scenes of sin
which he had witnessed, and in which
he had participated; and he could not
but shudder when he thought of the
probable termination of such a life.</p>

<p>But he felt that, having forsaken his
home,&mdash;and he was not even yet sorry
that he had done so,&mdash;he was now in
the current, and that there was no way
of reaching the shore, even had he been
disposed to try; and that he must continue
to float along the stream, leaving
his destination to be determined by circumstances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56" href="#Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>It is very easy to find the paths of
sin. It is easy, and, for a season, may
seem pleasant, to travel in them. The
entrance is inviting, the way is broad,
companions are numerous and gay. But
when the disappointed and alarmed traveller,
terrified at the thought of its termination,
seeks to escape, and hunts for
the narrow path of virtue, he finds obstacles
and entanglements which he cannot
climb over nor break. It requires
an Omnipotent arm to help him then.</p>

<p>Rodney fell asleep.</p>

<p>How long he had slept he knew not;
but he was awakened by a violent shaking
and by terrible oaths. The side-door
leading into the yard was open, and
three or four wretched-looking women
were scolding and swearing angrily about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57" href="#Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
him. He was confused, bewildered, but
soon perceived that something unusual
had happened; and he became very
much frightened as he at last learned the
truth from the excited women.</p>

<p>Bill Seegor was gone. He had got
up quietly when all were asleep, and,
drawing the woman's trunk from under
her bed, had carried it out into the yard,
pried open the lock, stolen the money,
and escaped.</p>

<p>The woman was in a terrible passion,
and her raving curses were fearful to
hear. Rodney pitied her, though she
cursed him. He was indignant at his
companion's rascality, and offered to go
with her and try to find him. It was
two o'clock in the morning. He looked
round for his hat, collar, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58" href="#Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>handkerchief;
but they were gone. The thief
had taken them with him. Taking Bill's
old hat, he went out with the woman,
and looked into the oyster-cellars and
grog-shops, some of which they found
still open; but they could find no trace
of Bill Seegor.</p>

<p>The woman met a watchman, and
made inquiries, and told him of the robbery.</p>

<p>"And this boy came with the man
last night, did he?" inquired the watchman.</p>

<p>"He did," said the woman.</p>

<p>"Do you know the boy?"</p>

<p>"I never saw him before."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess he knows where he
is, or where he can be found to-morrow."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59" href="#Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodney protested that he knew nothing
about him, that his own hat, collar,
and handkerchief had been stolen, and
that he had had nothing to do with the
robbery. He even told him where he
had met with Bill, and how he came to
be in his company.</p>

<p>"All very fine, my lad," said the
watchman; "but you must go with me.
This must be examined into to-morrow."</p>

<p>And he took Rodney by the arm, and
led him to the watch-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60" href="#Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE WATCH-HOUSE.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capf.jpg" width="115" height="115" alt="F" /></div><p>OR poor Rodney there was no
more sleep that night, even
had they placed him on a
bed of roses. But they locked him up
in a little square room, with an iron-barred
window, into which a dim light
struggled from a lamp hung outside in
the entry, showing a wooden bench, fastened
against the wall. There were four
men in the room.</p>

<p>One, whose clothes looked fine and
fashionable, but all covered with dirt,
lay on the floor. A hat, that seemed
new, but crushed out of all shape, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61" href="#Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
under his head for a pillow. His face
was bruised and bloody. He was entirely
stupefied, and Rodney saw at a
glance that he was intoxicated.</p>

<p>On the bench, stretched out at full
length, was a short, stout negro, fast
asleep. On another part of the bench
lay a white man, who seemed about fifty
years old, with a sneering, malicious
face, and wrapped up in a shaggy black
coat. The remaining occupant of the
cell sat in one corner, with his head down
on his knees, and his hat slouched over
his face.</p>

<p>Rodney stood for a few moments in
the middle of the cell, and, in sickening
dismay, looked round him. Here he was
with felons and rioters, locked up in a
dungeon! True, he had committed no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62" href="#Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
crime against the law; but yet he felt
that he deserved it all; and the hot tears
rolled from his eyes as he thought of his
mother and his home.</p>

<p>Hearing his sobs, the man in the corner
raised his head, looked at him for a
moment, and said:</p>

<p>"Why, you blubbering boy, what have
you been about? Are you the pal of
these cracksmen, or have you been on a
lay on your own hook?"</p>

<p>Rodney did not know what he meant,
and he said so.</p>

<p>"I mean," said the man, in the same
low, thieves' jargon, "have you been
helping these fellows crack a crib?"</p>

<p>"Doing what?" said Rodney.</p>

<p>"Breaking into a house, you dumb-head."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64" href="#Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63" href="#Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/img066.jpg" width="400" height="337" alt="courtroom scene" title="courtroom scene" />
</div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65" href="#Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy shuddered at the thought of
being taken for an accomplice of house-breakers;
and told him he knew nothing
about them. He had read that boys are
sometimes employed by house-breakers
to climb in through windows or broken
pannels, to open the door on the inside;
and now he was thought to be such a one
himself.</p>

<p>It was a dismal night for him.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the prisoners
were all taken before a magistrate.</p>

<p>The drunkard, who claimed to be a
gentleman, and who had been taken to
the watch-house for assaulting the barkeeper
of a tavern, was fined five dollars,
and dismissed.</p>

<p>The negro and the old white man had
been caught in the attempt to break into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66" href="#Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a house, and were sent to prison, to
await their trial for burglary; and the
other white man was also sent to prison,
until he could be tried, for stealing a
pocket-book in an auction store.</p>

<p>Rodney was then called forward. The
watchman told how and why he had taken
him; and the boy was asked to give an
account of himself. He told his story
truthfully and tearfully, while the magistrate
looked coldly at him.</p>

<p>"A very good story," said the magistrate;
"it seems to be well studied. I
suspect you are an artful fellow, notwithstanding
your innocent face. I shall
bind you over for trial, my lad. I think
such boys as you should be stopped in
time; and a few years in some penitentiary
would do you good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67" href="#Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>What could Rodney say? What could
he do? He was among strangers. He
could send for no one to testify of his
good character, or to become bail for
him. And, if his friends had been near,
he felt that he had rather die than that
they should know of his disgrace.</p>

<p>The magistrate gave an officer a paper&mdash;a
commitment&mdash;and told him to take
the boy to the Arch-street jail. The
constable took him by the arm, and led
him out.</p>

<p>As they walked along the street, Rodney
looked around him to see if there
was no way of escape. If he could only
get a chance to run! As they came to
the corner of a little alley, he asked the
constable to let him tie his shoe, the
string of which was loose. The man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68" href="#Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
nodded, and Rodney placed his foot upon
a door-step, sheering round beyond
the reach of the officer's hand, and towards
the alley. Rodney, as he rose,
made one spring, and in a moment was
gone down the alley. The officer rushed
after him, and shouted, "Stop thief!
stop thief!"</p>

<p>"O, that I should ever be chased for
a thief!" groaned Rodney, clenching
his teeth together, and running at his
best speed.</p>

<p>That terrible cry, "<i>Stop thief!</i>" rung
after him, and soon seemed to be echoed
by a hundred voices, as the boy dashed
along Ninth street and down Market
street; and, from behind him, and from
doors and windows, and from the opposite
side of the street, and at length<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69" href="#Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
from before him, the very welkin rung
with the cries of "Stop thief! stop
thief!" A hundred eyes were strained
to catch a glimpse of the culprit; but
Rodney dashed on, the crowd never
thinking that <i>he</i> was the hunted fox, but
only one of the hounds in pursuit, eager
to be "in at the death." At the corner
of Fifth and Market-streets, a porter
was standing by his wheelbarrow.
He saw the chase coming down, and
truly scented the victim; and, as Rodney
neared the corner, he suddenly
pushed out his barrow across the pavement.
Rodney could not avoid it; he
stumbled, fell across it, and was captured.</p>

<p>"You young scoundrel! is this one
of your tricks?" said the constable, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70" href="#Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
he came up; "I'll teach you one of
mine;" and he struck him a blow on
the side of the head, that knocked the
poor boy senseless on the pavement.</p>

<p>Those who stood by cried, "Shame!
shame!" and the officer glared furiously
around him; but, seeing that the numbers
were against him, he raised the boy
from the ground. Rodney soon recovered;
and the constable, grasping him
firmly by the wrist of his coat, and,
drawing his arm tightly under his own,
led him, followed by a crowd of hooting
boys, up Fifth, and through Arch-street,
toward the old jail.</p>

<p>What a walk was that to poor Rodney!
The officer, stern and angry,
held him with so firm a grip as to convince
him of the uselessness of a second
attempt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71" href="#Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Fatigued, and nearly fainting as he
was from the race and the blow, he was
compelled almost to run, to keep up with
the long strides of the constable. A
crowd of boys pressed around, to get a
glimpse of his face.</p>

<p>"What has he done?" one would
ask of another.</p>

<p>"Broke open a trunk, and stole
money," would be the reply.</p>

<p>Rodney pulled Bill Seegor's old hat
over his face, and hung his head, in bitter
anguish of soul, as he heard himself
denounced as a thief at every step; and
as he heard doors dashed open, and
windows thrown up, similar questions
and replies smote his heart. He knew
that he was innocent of such a crime;
his soul scorned it; he felt that he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72" href="#Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
incapable of theft; but he felt that he
had been too guilty, too disobedient and
too ungrateful, to dare to hold up his
head, or utter a word in his own defence.
It seemed as though that long
and terrible walk with the constable
would never end, and he felt relieved
when he reached the heavy door of the
jail, amid two files of staring boys, who
had ran before him, and arranged themselves
by the gate, to watch him as he
entered. He was rudely thrust in, the
bolt shot back upon the closed door, and
he was delivered over to the keeping of
the jailer, with the assurance of the
policeman, that "he was a sharp miscreant,
and needed to be watched."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73" href="#Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>RODNEY IN JAIL.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/caps.jpg" width="115" height="117" alt="S" /></div><p>UCH are the rewards which
sin gives to its votaries; full
of soft words and tempting
promises in the beginning, they find, in
the end, that "it biteth like a serpent,
and stingeth like an adder." Thoughts
like these passed through Rodney's
mind, as the jailer led him to a room in
which were confined three other lads,
all older than himself. At that time,
the system of solitary confinement had
not been adopted in Pennsylvania, and
prisoners were allowed to associate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74" href="#Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>together;
but it was deemed best to keep
the boys from associating with older and
more hardened culprits, whose conversation
might still more corrupt them,
and they were therefore confined together,
apart from the mass of the
criminals.</p>

<p>At first Rodney suffered the most
intense anguish. A sense of shame and
degradation overwhelmed him. He staggered
to a corner of the room, threw
himself on the floor, and, for a long
time, sobbed and wept as though his
very heart would break. For a while
the boys seemed to respect his grief,
and left him in silence. At last one of
them went to him, and said,</p>

<p>"Come, there's no use in this; we
are all here together, and we may as
well make the best of it!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75" href="#Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodney sat up, and looked at them,
as they gathered around him.</p>

<p>They were ragged in dress, and pale
from their confinement, and Rodney involuntarily
shrank from the idea of associating
with them, regarding them as
criminals in jail. But he soon remembered
his own position,&mdash;that he was
now one of them,&mdash;and he thought he
would take their advice, and "make the
best of it."</p>

<p>"Well, what did they squeeze you
into this jug for, my covey?" asked the
eldest boy.</p>

<p>Rodney told them his story, and protested
that he was innocent of any
crime.</p>

<p>The boy put his thumb to the end of
his nose, and twirled his fingers, saying,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76" href="#Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
"You can't gammon us, my buck;
come, out with it, for we never <i>peach</i> on
one another."</p>

<p>Rodney was very angry at this mode
of treating his story. But, in spite of
himself, he gradually became familiar
with the companions thus forced upon
him, and, in a day or two, began to
engage with them in their various sports,
to while away the weary hours. Sometimes
they sat and told stories, to amuse
one another; and thus Rodney heard
tales of wickedness and depredation and
cunning, that almost led him to doubt
whether there was any honesty among
men. They talked of celebrated thieves
and robbers, burglars and pirates, as if
they were the models by which they
meant to mould their own lives; and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77" href="#Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
instead of detesting their crimes, Rodney
began to admire the skill and success
with which they were perpetrated.
The excitement and freedom, and wild,
frenzied enjoyment of such a life, as
depicted by the young knaves, began to
fascinate and charm his mind. Something
seemed to whisper in his ear, "As
you are now disgraced, without any fault
of your own, why not carry it out, and
make the most of it? They have put
you into jail, this time, for nothing; if
they ever do it again, let them have
some reason for it." Who knows what
might have been the result of such
temptations and influences, had these
associations been long continued, and
not counteracted by the interposition of
God?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78" href="#Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>But then the instructions of childhood,
the lessons of home and of the
Sabbath-school, were brought back to
his memory, and he said to himself,
"What, be a thief! Make myself despised
and hated by all good people!
Live a life of wickedness and dread,&mdash;perhaps
die in the penitentiary, and
then, in all probability, lose my soul,
and be cast into hell! No, never! I
shall never dare to steal, or to break
into houses; and as for killing anybody
for money, I shudder even at the
thought!"</p>

<p>So did the bad and the good struggle
together in the heart of the poor boy.
How many there are who, at the first,
feel and think about crime as he did,
but who, in the end, become familiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79" href="#Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
with vice, lose their sense of fear and
shame and guilt, become bold and reckless
in sin, having their consciences
seared as with a hot iron, and violating
all laws, human and divine, without
compunction, and without a thought
save that of impunity and success!</p>

<p>All the elements of a life of crime
were in the heart of this wayward boy;
and had it not been for the instructions
of his childhood, which counteracted
these evil influences, and the providence
and grace of God, which restrained him,
he would have become a miserable outcast
from society, leading a wretched
life of shame and guilt.</p>

<p>"I wish we had a pack of cards
here," said one of the boys, one weary
afternoon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80" href="#Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't we make a pack?" inquired
another.</p>

<p>And then the lads set their wits to
work, and soon manufactured a substitute
for a pack of cards. They had a
couple of old newspapers, which they
folded and cut into small, regular pieces,
and marked each piece with the spots
that are found on playing cards, making
rude shapes of faces, and writing
"<i>Jack</i>," "<i>King</i>," "<i>Knave</i>," &amp;c., under
them. With these, they used to spend
hours shuffling and dealing and playing,
until Rodney understood the pernicious
game as well as the rest.</p>

<p>"Joe," said Rodney, one day, to the
oldest boy, "what did they put you in
here for?"</p>

<p>"Well," said he, "I'll tell you.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81" href="#Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Sam and I run with the Moyamensing
Hose Company. Many a jolly time we
have had of it, running to fires, and
many a good drink of liquor we have
had, too; for when the people about the
fires treated the firemen, we boys used
to come in for our share of the treat.
There was a standing quarrel between
us and the 'Franklin' boys, and we
used to have a fight whenever we could
get at them. I heard one of the men
say, one day, that if there was only a
fire down Twelfth or Thirteenth-street,
and the 'Franklin' should come up in
that direction, we could get them foul,
and give them a good drubbing. Well,
there <i>was</i> a fire down Twelfth-street the
next night! I don't mean to say who
kindled it; but a watchman saw Sam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82" href="#Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and me about the stable, and then running
away from it as fast as we could.
The fellow marked us, and as we were
going back to the fire with the machine,
he nabbed us, and walked us off to the
watch-house, and the next day we were
stuck into this hole."</p>

<p>"But <i>did</i> you set fire to the stable?"</p>

<p>"What would you give to know? I
make no confessions; and if you ever
tell out of doors what I have said here,
I'll knock your teeth down your throat,
if I ever catch you."</p>

<p>These two boys had actually been
guilty of the dreadful crime of setting
fire to a stable. It was used by two or
three poor men for their horses and
carts, which was the only means they
had of making an honest living; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83" href="#Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
yet these wicked boys had tried to burn
it down, just for the fun of going to a
fire, and getting up a fight! There are
other boys, in large cities, who will commit
similar acts; but such young villains
are ripe for almost any crime, and must,
in all human probability, come to some
dreadful end.</p>

<p>"Hank," said Rodney to another boy,&mdash;his
real name was Henry, but Hank
was his prison name,&mdash;"tell us now
what you have done."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you nothing about it."</p>

<p>"What is your last name, Hank?"
inquired Sam, after a few moments'
pause.</p>

<p>"Johnson," said Hank.</p>

<p>"Ah! I know now what you did. I
read it in the paper, just before I came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84" href="#Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
in, and, somehow, I thought you was
one of the larks as soon as I clapped
eyes on you.</p>

<p>"You see, Hank and some of his gang,
watching about, saw a house in Arch-street,
and noticed that it was empty.
The family, I suppose, had all gone to the
country, and it was shut up. So, one
Sunday afternoon, four of them climbed
over the back gate into the yard, pried
open a window-shutter, got in, and
helped themselves to whatever they
could lay their hands on. After dark
they sneaked out at the back gate with
their plunder. One of them was caught,
trying to sell some of the things, and he
peached, and they jugged them all.
Isn't that the fact, Hank?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's no use lying; it was
pretty much so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85" href="#Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"What became of the other fellows,
Hank?"</p>

<p>"Why, their fathers or friends bailed
them out, and I have no father, or anybody
who cares for me. But"&mdash;and
he swore a fearful oath&mdash;"if ever I
catch that white-livered Jim Hulsey,
who was the ringleader in the whole
scheme, and got me into the scrape, and
then blowed me, to save himself, I'll
beat him to a mummy, I will."</p>

<p>And <i>these</i> were the companions with
whom Rodney was compelled to associate!
Sometimes he shrank from them
with loathing; and sometimes he almost
envied the hardihood with which they
boasted of their crimes. Had he remained
in their company much longer,
who can tell to what an extent he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86" href="#Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
have been contaminated, and how rapidly
prepared for utter moral degradation and
eternal ruin?</p>

<p>What afterwards became of them,
Rodney never knew; but they are probably
either dead,&mdash;God having said,
"The wicked shall not live out half their
days,"&mdash;or else preying upon society
by the commission of more dreadful
crimes, or perhaps spending long years
of life in the penitentiary, confined to
hard labor and prison fare.</p>

<p>One day, after he had been about two
weeks in jail, Rodney took the basin in
which they had washed, and threw the
water out of the window. The grated
bars prevented his seeing whether there
was any one below. He had often done
so before. It had not been forbidden.
He did not intend to do any wrong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87" href="#Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>But it happened that one of the keepers
was walking under the window, and
the water fell upon his head.</p>

<p>He came to the door, in a great rage,
and asked who had thrown that water
out. Rodney at once said that he had
done it, but that he did not know that
he had done any harm.</p>

<p>The man took him roughly by the
arm, and, telling him he must come with
him, led him through a long corridor to
another part of the prison, and thrust
him into a small, dark dungeon.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88" href="#Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE DUNGEON.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capt.jpg" width="115" height="119" alt="T" /></div><p>HE room was very small,&mdash;a
mere closet,&mdash;lighted only
by a narrow window over the
door, which admitted just light enough
from the corridor to enable Rodney to
see the walls. There was some scribbling
on the walls, but there was not
light enough, even after his eyes became
accustomed to the place, to distinguish
a letter.</p>

<p>There was neither chair nor bench,
not even a blanket, on which to lie.
The bare walls and floor were unrelieved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89" href="#Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
by a single article of comfort. Here,
for four long days and nights, Rodney
was confined. There was nothing by
which he could relieve the dreadful
wearisome time. He heard no voice
save that of the surly jailer, once a day,
bringing him a rough jug of water and
half a loaf of black bread. He had no
books with which to while away the
long, tedious hours, nor was there light
enough to read, had there been a whole
library in the cell.</p>

<p>The first emotions of the boy, when
the door was locked upon him, were
those of indignation and anger. "Why,"
said he to himself, "am I treated in this
way? They are brutes! I have done
nothing to deserve this barbarity. I am
no felon or thief, that I should be used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90" href="#Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
in this way. I have broken no rule that
was made known to me, since I have
been in this place. The heartless wretch
of a jailer thrust me into this hole, to
gratify his own spite. He knows that
I couldn't have thrown water on him
purposely, for I couldn't see down into
the yard. He never told me what I was
to do with the dirty water, and there
was no other place to throw it. He
deserves being shut up in this den himself!
O, I wish I had him in my power
for a week! I would give him a lesson
that he would remember as long as he
lived.</p>

<p>"Was there ever such an unlucky
boy as I am? Everything goes against
me. There is no chance for me to do
anything, or to enjoy anything, in this
world. I wish I was dead!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91" href="#Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>A bitter flood of tears burst from him,
which seemed, as it were, to quench his
anger, and gradually his heart became
open to more salutary reflections.</p>

<p>"Do you not deserve all this?"
whispered his conscience. "Have you
not brought it upon yourself by your
own wickedness and disobedience? You
had a good home and kind friends; and
if you had to work every day, it was no
more than all have to do in one form or
another. Blame yourself, then, for your
own idle, reckless disposition, that would
not be satisfied with your lot. You are
only finding out the truth of the text
you have often repeated,&mdash;'The way of
the transgressor is hard.'"</p>

<p>He thought of his home, as he lay upon
that hard floor. The forms of his pious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92" href="#Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
old grandmother, and of his mother and
sister, all seemed to stand before him,
and to look down upon him reproachfully.
He remembered now their kindness
and good counsel. He groaned in
bitterness, "O! this <i>would</i> break their
hearts, if they knew it! I have disgraced
myself, and I have disgraced
them." He had leisure for reflection,
and his mind recalled, most painfully,
the scenes of the past. He thought of
the Sabbath-school, of his kind teacher,
and of the instructions that had been so
affectionately imparted. How much better
for him would it have been, had he
regarded those instructions!</p>

<p>And then he thought of God! He
remembered that His <i>all-seeing eye</i> had
followed all his wanderings, and noted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93" href="#Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
all his guilt. He had sinned against
God, and some of the bitterness of punishment
had already overtaken him.
The idea that God was angry with him,
and that <i>He</i> was visiting his sins with
the rod of chastisement, took possession
of his soul. Now he ceased to blame
others for his sufferings, and acknowledged
to himself that all was deserved.
Again he wept, but it was in terror at
the thought of God's anger, and in
grief that he had sinned so ungratefully
against his Maker.</p>

<p>He tried to pray; but the words of the
prayers he had been taught in his childhood
did not seem to be appropriate
to his present condition. Those prayers
were associated with days and scenes of
comparative innocence and happiness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94" href="#Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
He now felt guilty and wretched, and felt
deeply that other forms of petition were
necessary for him. But he could not
frame words into a prayer that would
soothe and relieve his soul. "God will
not hear me," was his bitter thought.
"I do not deserve to be heard. O! if
God would have mercy upon me, and
deliver me from this trouble, I think I
would try to serve and obey Him as long
as I lived."</p>

<p>He kneeled down upon the hard floor,
and raised his clasped hands and streaming
eyes toward heaven; but he could
find no utterance for his emotions, save
in sobs and tears. Prayer would not
come in words. Again and again he
tried to pray, but in vain; he felt that
he could not pray; and, almost in de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95" href="#Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>spair,
he paced the narrow cell, and was
ready to believe that God's favor was
forever withdrawn from his soul,&mdash;that
there was no ear to listen, and no arm to
save, and that nothing was left for him
in the future but a life of misery, a
death of shame, and an eternity of woe!</p>

<p>On the third morning, he awoke from
a troubled sleep, and, as he rose with
aching bones from the bare planks, his
limbs trembled and tottered beneath him.
Finding that he could not stand, he sat
down in the corner of the dungeon, and
leaned against the wall. His head was
hot, and his throat parched, and the
blood beat in throbs through his veins.
A sort of delirious excitement began to
creep over him, and his mind was filled
with strange reveries.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96" href="#Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw, or fancied he saw, great
spiders crawling over the wall, and serpents,
lizards, and indescribable reptiles,
creeping about on the floor; and he
shouted at them, and kicked at them, as
they seemed to come near him. Soon
they were viewed without dread or terror.
He laughed at their motions, and
thought he should have companions and
pets in his loneliness; still he did not
wish them to come too near.</p>

<p>Then there seemed to be other shapes
in his cell. His old grandmother sat in
one corner, reading, through her familiar
spectacles, the well-worn family Bible.
His sister sat there, playing with her
baby, and his mother was singing as
she sewed. And he laughed and talked
to them, but could get no answer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97" href="#Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Occasionally he felt a half-consciousness
that it was all a delusion,&mdash;a
mere vision of the brain; and yet
their fancied presence made him happy,
and he laughed and talked incessantly,
as if they heard him, and were wondering
at his own strange emotions.</p>

<p>And then the gruff voice of the jailer
scared away his visions, and roused him
for a moment from his reveries.</p>

<p>"You are merry, my boy, and you
make too much noise," said the keeper.</p>

<p>The interruption made his head swim,
and he attempted to rise; but he was
very weak and faint, and fell back again.
He turned to say, "I believe I am
sick;" but before the words found utterance,
the man had set down his pitcher
and bread, and was gone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98" href="#Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>There was an interval of dreary, blank
darkness, and then there were other
visions, too wild and strange to describe,
and soon the darkness of annihilation
settled upon his soul. How long a time
elapsed while in this state of insensibility,
he could not say; but he was at
length half-aroused by voices near him,
and he was conscious that some hand was
feeling for his pulse, and that men were
carrying him out of the dungeon. He
afterwards learned that it was the jailer
and the physician.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99" href="#Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>THE HOSPITAL.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capu.jpg" width="115" height="116" alt="U" /></div><p>PON a narrow cot, in the Hospital
apartment of the jail,
they laid Rodney, and immediately
prepared the medicines suited to
his case. The medicines were at length
administered, and, with a pleasant consciousness
of comfort and attention, he
fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, it was evening; he
was perfectly conscious, and felt better;
but it was a long time before he could
recall his thoughts, and understand
where he was, and how he had come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100" href="#Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
thither. He looked around him, and
saw a line of cots on each side of him.
About a dozen of them were occupied
by sick men. A large case of medicines,
placed on a writing-desk, stood at one
end of the room. Two or three men,
who acted as nurses, were sitting near
it, talking and laughing together. In
another part of the room, by a grated
window, looking out upon the pleasant
sunset, were two of the convalescent
prisoners, pale and thin, conversing
softly and sadly. There was not a face
he knew,&mdash;none that seemed to feel
the slightest interest for him; and the
wicked scenes of the past two months,
and the unhappy circumstances of the
present hour, flashed through his mind,
and he hid his face in his pillow and
wept.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101" href="#Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>He heard steps softly approach his
cot, and knew that some one was standing
beside him. But he could not stifle
his sobs, and he did not dare to look up.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see that you are better,
though I am sorry to see you so
much troubled, my poor boy," said a
soft, kind voice.</p>

<p>It was long since he had been spoken
to in a kind tone, and he only wept the
more bitterly, and convulsively pressed
his face closer to the pillow. Presently
he felt an arm passed slowly under the
pillow, which wound around his neck, and
gently drew his head toward the stranger.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said the same soft
voice, "don't give way to such grief;
look up, and talk to me. Let me be a
friend to you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102" href="#Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodney yielded to the encircling arm,
and turned his tearful eyes to the man
who spoke to him.</p>

<p>He was a tall, slender man, pale from
sickness, decently dressed, and with an
intelligent, benevolent countenance. He
was one of those whom Rodney had
observed looking out of the window.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" said he;
"what has brought you into this horrible
place?"</p>

<p>The confidence of the boy was easily
won. He had felt an inexpressible desire
to talk to some one, and now he
was ready to lay open his whole heart
at the first intimation of sympathy.</p>

<p>"I ran away from home," was the
frank and truthful reply.</p>

<p>"But they do not put boys in jail for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103" href="#Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
running away; you must have done
something else."</p>

<p>"I was charged with something else;
but indeed, indeed, I am innocent!"</p>

<p>"That is very possible," said he,
with a sigh; "but what did they charge
you with doing?"</p>

<p>And Rodney moved closer to him,
and leaned his head upon his breast, and
told him all. There was such an evident
sincerity, such consistency, such
tones of truth in the simple narrative,
that he saw he was believed, and the
sympathizing words and looks of the
listener inspired him with trust, as
though he was talking to a well-known
friend.</p>

<p>For several days, they were constantly
together; the stranger waited upon <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104" href="#Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Rodney,
and gave him his medicine, and
helped him from his cot, talked with
him, and manifested for him the kindness
of a brother. From several conversations,
Rodney gleaned from him
the following history.</p>

<p>Lewis Warren,&mdash;so will we call him&mdash;(indeed,
Rodney never knew his true
name),&mdash;was born and had lived most
of his life in a New England village.
He was the son of a farmer; a pious
man, and deacon of a church, by whose
help he received a liberal education.
Soon after he had graduated at &mdash;&mdash;
College, he came on to Philadelphia,
with the expectation of getting into
some business. At the hotel where he
stopped, he became acquainted with a
man of very gentlemanly appearance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105" href="#Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and address, who said that he, too, was
a stranger in the city, and proposed to
accompany him to some places of amusement.
Warren went with him to the
theatre, and, on succeeding evenings, to
various places of amusement. As they
were one evening strolling up Chestnut-street,
this friend, Mr. Sharpe, stopped
at the well-lighted vestibule of a stately
building, that had the air of a private
house, although it was thrown open, and
proposed that they should go in, and see
what was going on there. Warren consented,
and, after ascending to the second
floor, and passing through a hall,
they entered a large, brilliantly-lighted
billiard saloon. Around several tables
were gathered gentlemanly-looking men,
knocking about little ivory balls, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106" href="#Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
long, slender wands or cues, and seeming,
evidently, engrossed in their respective
games. After looking around
for a while, Sharpe proposed going up
stairs into the third story. They ascended
to the upper rooms. In the
upper passage stood a stout, short negro-man,
who glanced at Sharpe, stepped
one side, and permitted them to pass
unquestioned. They entered another
smaller room,&mdash;for the third story was
divided into several rooms,&mdash;and found
other games than those exhibited below.
After walking through some of the
rooms, and observing the different games,
most of which were new to Warren, his
companion said to him:</p>

<p>"Do you understand anything about
cards?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107" href="#Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a great deal; I have occasionally
played a game of whist or sledge."</p>

<p>"Well, that is about the sum of my
knowledge. Suppose we while away a
half-an-hour at one of these vacant
tables."</p>

<p>Warren consented, and they sat down.
After playing a game or two, Sharpe
proposed having a bottle of wine, and,
said he, laughingly, "Whoever loses
the next game, shall pay for it."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Warren; and the
wine was brought, and he won the
game.</p>

<p>"Well, that is your good luck; but
I'll bet you the price of another bottle
you can't do it again."</p>

<p>Warren won again.</p>

<p>They tried a third, and that Sharpe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108" href="#Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
won; a fourth, and Warren rose the
winner.</p>

<p>The next evening found them, somehow,
without much talk about it, at the
same place. They played with varied
success; but when they left, Warren
had lost ten dollars.</p>

<p>He wanted to win it back, and himself
proposed the visit for the third
night. He became excited by the
game, and lost seventy dollars.</p>

<p>Still his eyes were not open; he did
not dream that he was in the hands of
a professed gambler, and, hoping to get
back what he had lost, and what he felt
he really could not spare from his small
amount of funds, he went again.</p>

<p>"There!" said he, after they had
been about an hour at the table, "there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109" href="#Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
is my last fifty-dollar bill; change that,
and I'll try once more."</p>

<p>"Well," said Sharpe, "here is the
change; but the luck seems against you.
We had better stop for to-night."</p>

<p>But Warren insisted upon continuing,
and he won thirty dollars in addition to
the fifty which Sharpe had changed for
him. The gambler then rose, and told
him that he would give him a chance to
win all back another time, as fortune
seemed to be again propitious to him.</p>

<p>Warren never saw him after that
night. The next morning he determined
to seek a more private boarding
house, and economize his remaining
funds, and seek more assiduously some
business situation. He stepped to the
bar to pay his board, handing the clerk<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110" href="#Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
one of the notes he had received in
change for his last fifty-dollar bill. The
clerk examined it a moment, and passed
it back, saying, "That is a counterfeit
note, sir." He took it back, amazed,
and offered another.</p>

<p>"This is worse still," said the clerk.
"I think we had better take care of
you, sir. You will please go with me
before a magistrate."</p>

<p>"But I did not know&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>"You can tell that to the squire."</p>

<p>"You have no right to take me,"
said Warren; "you have no warrant."</p>

<p>"No; but I can keep you here till I
send for one, which I shall certainly do,
unless you consent to go willingly."</p>

<p>And Warren, conscious of his own
innocence in this respect, and never<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111" href="#Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
thinking of the difficulty of proving it,
went to a magistrate's office with the
clerk at once.</p>

<p>The clerk entered his complaint, and,
besides swearing to the offer of the
notes, swore that he had seen him, for
several days past, in the company of a
notorious gambler.</p>

<p>Warren was stunned, overwhelmed,
by this declaration. No representation
that he made was believed. His pockets
were searched, and all the money he had,
except some small change, was found to
be counterfeit. A commitment was at
once made out against him, and he was
sent to jail, to await his trial on the
charge of passing counterfeit money.</p>

<p>This is one of the methods by which
professional gamblers "pluck young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112" href="#Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
pigeons." No young man is safe who
allows himself to play with cards, or to
handle dice.</p>

<p>Rodney believed that Warren had
told him the truth, and fellowship in
misfortune drew the hearts of the duped
man and the wronged boy towards each
other; for though both had been very
much to blame, yet duped and wronged
they had been by knaves more cunning
and wicked than themselves.</p>

<p>They had many serious conversations
together, for both had been piously instructed,
and Warren, who seemed truly
penitent for his wanderings, as he sat
by the bed-side of the sick boy, encouraged
him in his resolutions to lead a
different life,&mdash;to seek the forgiveness
and grace of God through a merciful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113" href="#Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
Redeemer. Seldom has a poor prisoner
received sweeter sympathy, or more
salutary counsel, than was given to Rodney
within the walls of that old Arch-street
jail, by his fellow-prisoner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115" href="#Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>"Rodney," said Warren to him one
day,&mdash;it was the first day that he had
left his cot,&mdash;"I shall soon leave this
place; I have written to my father, and
he will be here at the trial with such
evidences in my favor, from the whole
course of my life, as cannot fail to secure
me an acquittal. I feel no doubt that
this stain upon my character will be
wiped away. And I believe that I shall
have reason to thank God, as long as I
live, for having permitted this trouble.
It is a very hard lesson, but I trust it
will be a salutary one. Since I have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116" href="#Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
been here, I have prayed earnestly to
God for the pardon of my sins. I have
resolved, in sincerity of soul, to consecrate
my affections and my life to his
service. I have had a severe struggle;
but I believe, I <i>feel</i>, that God has heard
my prayers, forgiven my iniquities, and
the last few days in this jail have been
the happiest of my life. I feel that I
hate the sins of which my heart has
been so full, and that I love God even
for the severe providences that have
checked my course of impenitence. I
feel like a new man; and if I am not
deceiving myself,&mdash;and I pray that I
may not be,&mdash;I have experienced that
regeneration of heart of which I have
so often heard, but which I could never
before comprehend.</p>

<p>"I hope that you, too, will try and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117" href="#Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
seek the Saviour, pray to him for forgiveness,
and beg the guidance of His
Holy Spirit for your future life. If we
both do this sincerely, we shall have
reason forever to bless God for the way
in which he has led us."</p>

<p>"Pray for me," said Rodney; while
tears rolled down his pale cheeks. "I
want to be a Christian, and I hope that
God will have mercy upon me, and guide
me, for the future, in the right path."</p>

<p>A few days after, Warren was called
into court to take his trial; and, to Rodney's
great delight,&mdash;for he had learned
to love him like a brother,&mdash;he heard
from one of the nurses that he had been
honorably acquitted.</p>

<p>During the same week, the case of
Rodney was called up, and he was conducted
by an officer to the court-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118" href="#Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<h3>THE TRIAL.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/capj.jpg" width="115" height="119" alt="J" /></div><p>USTICE was now to be administered,
and Rodney was
brought into the crowded
court-room for trial. The officer led
him to the prisoner's narrow dock, an
enclosed bench, at each end of which
sat a constable, with a long staff in his
hand. There were five or six other
prisoners sitting in the dock with him.
Next to him was a woman, her garments
ragged, her hair matted, and her face
red and bloated. Next to her sat
a squalid negro, who seemed totally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119" href="#Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
indifferent to the scenes that were passing
around him. On the other side of
him was a young man, apparently about
twenty years old, of thin, spare form,
with a red flush at intervals coloring his
cheek, and a hollow cough that sounded
like an echo from the grave. He was
evidently in a deep consumption, and
had been already several months in prison.
And he leaned his head upon the
railing, as though he would hide himself
from every eye. He had been tried a
few days before, for having been associated
with others in a burglary, and
found guilty, and he was now present to
hear his sentence.</p>

<p>After the formal opening of the court,
this young man was the first called upon,
and, with trembling limbs, he rose to hear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120" href="#Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the sentence of the judge. After some
remarks upon the enormity of his crime,
and the clear evidence upon which he
had been convicted, the judge sentenced
him to five years' imprisonment in the
penitentiary. When those words, <i>five
years</i>, reached him, he dropped back
upon the seat, as if struck with a bullet,
and then raising his face to the judge,
with an expression of profound anguish,
said, "Half the time would be more
than enough, your honor; I shall be in
the grave before one year is past."</p>

<p>The case of the negro-man was immediately
called up, but Rodney heard
nothing of it. He hid his face in his
hands, and wept. A sense of his terrible
position flashed upon him, and he
could not keep back his tears, or stifle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121" href="#Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
his sobs. He wept aloud, and <i>felt</i>,
though he might not see, that all eyes
were turned upon him. His whole frame
shook with the anguish of his soul.</p>

<p>Presently a hand was laid upon his,
and a head was bent over the bar near
him, and a voice addressed him kindly:
"Be calm, my boy; there is no good
in crying; who is your counsel?"</p>

<p>Rodney looked up, and saw a young
man, well dressed, and with an affable
and winning countenance, standing before
him. His face looked kind and
benevolent, at least in Rodney's eyes,
for he had spoken to him gently and
encouragingly.</p>

<p>He replied to his question, "I have
no counsel, sir; I have no money."</p>

<p>"Well, I will try what I can do for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122" href="#Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
you," said the young lawyer. "Come
out here, and sit by me, and tell me
what you are here for."</p>

<p>He led him out of the disgraceful
dock, gave him a seat directly in front
of the jury, sat down beside him, and
asked him to tell him the truth about all
the circumstances that led to his imprisonment
and trial. Rodney told him
truly all that happened from the time of
his running away to his arrest. He told
him, too, who he was, and who were his
relatives in the neighborhood of Philadelphia.
He had never spoken of these
before.</p>

<p>"Well," said the lawyer, "I don't
see that they can bring anything out to
hurt you, if that is the true statement
of the case. And now, my boy, you
may cry as much as you wish."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123" href="#Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Rodney looked up, surprised, wondering
what on earth he wanted him to cry
for. He thought afterwards that the
advice was probably given that his
weeping might affect the sympathies of
the jury, before whose eyes he was sitting.
But he could scarcely have shed
a tear then if his liberty had depended
upon it. He felt as though he had a
friend, and his consciousness of innocence
of any violation of human law,
and his confidence that his new friend
could show that he was guiltless, set his
perturbed heart at rest, and he felt sure
that he should be acquitted.</p>

<p>When the court adjourned, the lawyer
took out a card, and, giving it to Rodney,
said, "If your case should be
called up before I get here this after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124" href="#Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>noon,
just tell them that I am your
counsel, and they will put it off till I
come. Here is my name."</p>

<p>There was but one word on the card,
and Rodney kept it long as a grateful
memento of the disinterested kindness
that had been shown him in the hour
of his bitter trial. The name on the
card was</p>

<table class="bbox" summary="card">

<tr><td align='left'><table class="bbox2" summary="card">

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> This is not a fictitious but the real name of the
gentleman whose kindness it commemorates.</p></div>

<p>That young lawyer never knew the
gratitude with which his name was remembered
for long, long years, and the
thrill of emotion which its utterance
always excited in the heart of that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125" href="#Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
befriended boy. An act of kindness is
never lost, and many a one which the
benefactor may have forgotten, has won
for him the prayers and blessings of a
grateful heart.</p>

<p>During the recess, Rodney was conducted
across Independence-square to
the old Walnut-street prison. He ate
his scanty prison dinner that day with a
light and hopeful heart; and though he
trembled at the idea of the coming
trial, yet he did not for a moment doubt
that the result must be his acquittal.
He believed that the law was framed to
punish the guilty, and to do justice to
the innocent; and he could scarcely
conceive that the guiltless could be
made to suffer by its administration.</p>

<p>Immediately after the opening of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126" href="#Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
court, in the afternoon, the case was
called up. The woman in whose house
the robbery was committed, and one
other, were witnesses; but not one
word was said by either, in any way
implicating Rodney in the robbery, beyond
the fact that he had come to the
house in company with the robber.</p>

<p>His friend made a very brief speech,
demanding his acquittal; the judge said
a few words to the jury, who consulted
together for a moment, when the foreman
arose, and pronounced the happy
words, "<i>Not Guilty</i>."</p>

<p>And now the tears again rained down
the cheeks of Rodney, as he came out
of the infamous dock,&mdash;but they were
tears of joy.</p>

<p>A few kind questions were asked him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127" href="#Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
by the judge; and a small sum of money,
contributed by him and by several of the
members of the bar, furnished Rodney
the means of returning to his friends.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128" href="#Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>CONCLUSION.</h3>


<div class="figleft"style="width: 115px;"><img src="images/caph.jpg" width="115" height="118" alt="H" /></div><p>ASTENING to the end of our
narrative, we pass by several
intervening months, and witness
again another Sabbath morning in
May.</p>

<p>Some twenty miles from the city of
Philadelphia, a sparkling little brook
passes through the meadow of a beautiful
farm, losing itself in a thick wood
that divides the contiguous estates.</p>

<p>On that lovely May morning,&mdash;that
serene Sabbath,&mdash;there might have been
seen,&mdash;there was seen by the Omnis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129" href="#Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>cient
eye,&mdash;a lad, some fifteen years
old, walking thoughtfully along the margin
of that little stream, and penetrating
into the thickest part of the wood. He
carried a book in his hand, and sat
down close by the stream, under the
shade of an old beech tree. And as he
read, the tears streamed from his eyes,
and his sighs indicated a burdened spirit.
Indeed, his heart was very sad. He
was oppressed by the consciousness of
the great sinfulness of his life and heart
against the holy and benevolent God.
He remembered the early instructions
he had received at home and in the
Sabbath-school. He recalled the precious
privileges he had enjoyed, and he
remembered, with anguish and shame,
how wickedly he had disregarded all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130" href="#Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
these instructions, abused all these privileges,
and sinned against his own
knowledge of right, against his conscience
and his God. He had long been
burdened with these distressing emotions;
he had often prayed, but had
found little relief of his anguish, even
in prayer. And now, even on this calm
and beautiful Sabbath morning, there
seemed to his heart a gloom in the landscape.
There was a smile, he knew,
upon the face of nature, but he felt that
it beamed not for him. The carol of
wild birds rung out sweetly around him;
but the music saddened his heart yet
more, for there was no inward response
of gratitude and joy. The bright green
of the Spring foliage and of the waving
grass seemed dark and gloomy, as he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131" href="#Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
gazed upon it through tearful eyes. His
mourning spirit gave its own sombre
interpretation to all the lovely scenes of
nature. He deeply felt that he was a
wretched sinner against God, and he
could not see how God could be merciful
to one who had so grievously transgressed.
He scarcely dared to hope for
the pardon of his iniquities, and was in
almost utter despair of ever obtaining
mercy.</p>

<p>The book he had taken with him in his
morning walk, was "Doddridge's Rise
and Progress of Religion in the Soul."
He read, carefully, the twelfth chapter
in that excellent work, entitled, "The
invitation to Christ of the sinner overwhelmed
with a sense of the greatness
of his sins." He was convinced that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132" href="#Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Jesus Christ was <i>able</i> to save even <i>him</i>;
and the strong assurances of his <i>willingness</i>
to save, "even to the uttermost,"
furnished in the promises of the gospel,
began to dawn upon his mind as he read
what seemed like a new revelation to his
soul. When he read these words of
Jesus, "Come unto me, all ye that labor
and are heavy laden, and I will give you
rest,"&mdash;"Him that cometh unto me I
will in no wise cast out,"&mdash;though he
had read, or heard them read, a thousand
times before, it seemed now as though
they had been written expressly for him.
There seemed a freshness, a force, a
glorious personal adaptation in them
which he had never seen before.</p>

<p>He turned over the leaves of the
book, and the chapter on "Self <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133" href="#Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Dedication"
caught his eye. He read it; and
when he came to the prayer with which
that chapter closes, he kneeled down,
with the book open before him, and
solemnly, and with his whole heart, repeated
that fervent prayer. It seemed
to have been written on purpose to express
his emotions and desires. When
he had concluded, he closed the book,
and remained still upon his knees, and
tried, in his own language, to repeat
the sentiments of that solemn act of
Dedication. Never was a boy more
sincere and earnest than he.</p>

<p>How long he prayed he did not know;
but when he rose and looked round him,
the sun had long passed its meridian,
and the shadows of the trees were cast
towards the east.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134" href="#Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a delicious, joyful calm in
his soul. All doubts of God's willingness
to pardon and receive him had
gone. A veil seemed to have been removed
from the character of God. He
thought of God as he had never thought
before,&mdash;not as a stern and unrelenting
Judge, but as a forgiving, loving Father.
He saw, as he had never seen before,
how sinners could be adopted as children
of God, for the sake of the sufferings
and sacrifice of Jesus.</p>

<p>His spirit was very calm, but O, how
happy! He had solemnly given himself
to God, pleading the merits of Jesus
as the reason for his acceptance, and he
believed that God had received him,
pardoned his transgressions, and accepted
him as one of his own children. Again<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135" href="#Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and again did he throw himself on the
greensward, and pour out his soul in
gratitude and in prayer. It was the
happiest day his life had ever known.</p>

<p>The whole aspect of nature seemed
changed in his eyes. The gloomy
shroud, that seemed to envelop it in the
morning, had passed away. The smile
of God seemed reflected from every sunbeam
that played upon the green leaves
and danced over the distant waving
meadow. There was sweet melody now
in the songs of the birds, in the rippling
of the brook, in the hum of the bees,
and in the sighing of the soft breeze.
All seemed to sing of the goodness and
grace of the adorable Creator. "<i>Old</i>
things had passed away, behold all
things had become <i>new</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136" href="#Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>That lad was the <span class="smcap">Rodney Roverton</span>
of this little volume. That change was
wrought by the regenerating grace of
God. It was the "peace of God, that
passeth all understanding," diffused
through all his soul. Where "sin had
abounded, grace did much more abound."</p>

<p>Rodney Roverton yet lives. He has
been, for many years, a professed disciple
of Jesus Christ, and an honored
and successful minister of the Gospel.</p>
